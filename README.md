# 42_ft_printf

Write a library that contains ft_printf, a function that will mimic the real printf ! 


  - Recode the libc’s printf function
  - Manage the following conversions: cspdiuxX%
  - Manage any combination of the following flags: ’-0.*’
   and minimum field width with all conversions



Contains an awesome 4000 lines main to test the non bonus output of your ft_printf! Fun for the whole family!

/!\ this version of the test only compares string length for correction efficiency purposes.

Upgrade this test: turn your ft_printf into a sprintf and store its output as well as the real sprintf output to compare actual strings and get more accurate feedback.
